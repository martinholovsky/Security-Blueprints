# Kubernetes GitSecOps Reference Architecture



## Reference Architecture: Secure, Scalable, and Observable Kubernetes Platform

**1. Introduction:**

This document outlines the technology stack for [Project Name], a Kubernetes-based platform designed for deploying and managing secure, scalable, and observable microservices applications. The architecture emphasizes DevSecOps and GitOps principles, leveraging open-source tools to create a robust, resilient, and efficient environment.  The platform is built with security as a primary concern, incorporating multiple layers of defense and preparing for potential attacks.

**2. Key Design Principles:**

*   **Kubernetes-Native:** Leverage Kubernetes' core features and ecosystem.
*   **Resource Efficiency:** Optimize resource utilization to minimize costs and environmental impact.
*   **Scalability:** Design for horizontal scalability to handle increasing workloads.
*   **Multi-Cluster Support:** Enable management of multiple Kubernetes clusters (future-proofing).
*   **Service Mesh Capabilities:** Provide advanced networking, security, and observability features.
*   **GitOps Workflows:** Use Git as the single source of truth for all configurations, enabling automated deployments, version control, and auditability.
*   **Open Source Preferred:** Prioritize open-source tools for flexibility, transparency, and community support.
*   **High Focus on Security (DevSecOps/GitSecOps):** Integrate security into every stage of the development and deployment lifecycle, assuming potential breaches ("Death SecOps" mindset).
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Support asynchronous communication patterns for improved performance and resilience.
*   **eBPF Preferred:** Leverage eBPF technology for enhanced performance and security where possible.
*   **Declarative Configuration:** Utilize tools which will enforce a declarative approach.

**3. Technology Stack Overview:**

This technology stack is designed around a layered architecture, with each layer providing specific functionalities and interacting with other layers.

**(Insert your Mermaid diagram here.  The version with the "Key Requirements" node in the center is best. Update the diagram to remove OpenRASP and show only RabbitMQ. Update to show Suricata only.)**
