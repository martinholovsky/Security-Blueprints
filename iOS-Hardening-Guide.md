| **Setting** | **Location in Settings** | **What to Set Up** | **User Impact** | **Security Importance** | **ATT&CK TTPs** | **TTP Explanation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Initial Device Setup** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Apple ID** | Apple ID website or during device setup | - Create an Apple ID using an email address not directly linked to your personal information. <br> - Avoid using easily guessable security questions. | None | **Medium** | **Deters:** T1589 | **T1589:** Attackers gather information about the victim to use in social engineering or other attacks.  Using less personal information for your Apple ID makes you a less attractive target. |
| **Strong Passcode/Password** | `Settings > Face ID & Passcode` or `Settings > Touch ID & Passcode` | - Enable a strong passcode (at least 6 digits, preferably alphanumeric). - Disable "Simple Passcode". - Enable "Erase Data" (after 10 failed attempts). | Minor - May need to enter the passcode more often. | **Critical** | **Deters:** T1110: Brute Force T1649: Stored Data Manipulation **Delayed:** T1402: Data from Local System | - A strong passcode makes it significantly harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access through brute-force methods or to manipulate stored data. - Erasing data after failed attempts adds another layer of defense against local data access. |
| **Face ID/Touch ID** | `Settings > Face ID & Passcode` or `Settings > Touch ID & Passcode` | - Enable Face ID or Touch ID for unlocking the device and authorizing purchases. | Improvement - Faster and more convenient than entering a passcode. | **High** | **Detects:** T1110: Brute Force **Defends:** T1621: Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation | - Biometric authentication adds a layer of security beyond a passcode, making it harder for attackers to bypass lock screen security. - MFA request generation is harder to abuse with biometric auth as another factor. |
| **Automatic Lock** | `Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock` | - Set to 30 seconds or 1 minute. | Minor - Device locks more quickly when not in use. | **High** | **Delayed:** T1402: Data from Local System | - Reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized access if the device is left unattended. |
| **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** | `Settings > [Your Name] > Password & Security` | - Enable Two-Factor Authentication (Recommended: Yubikey 5C NFC). | Minor - Requires a second factor (e.g., Security Key, verification code) when signing in to Apple ID on a new device. | **Critical** | **Deters:** T1556: Modify Authentication Process **Detects:** T1110: Brute Force **Defends:** T1621: Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation | - 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your Apple ID even if they have your password. Brute-force and MFA bypass attacks are much harder to use. |
| **Software Updates** | `Settings > General > Software Update` | - Enable "Automatic Updates". - Regularly check for and install updates manually. | Minor - Updates may require device restarts. | **Critical** | **Deters:** T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter T1204: User Execution T1189: Drive-by Compromise **Denied:** T1203: Exploitation for Client Execution | - Software updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities. Automatic updates ensure the device is protected against known exploits, which are used by attackers to execute malicious commands, code or files. |
| **Data Encryption** (automatic) | `Face ID & Passcode` (or `Touch ID & Passcode`) - Check "Data Protection is Enabled" |  - Ensure a passcode is set (Encryption is enabled automatically on modern iOS devices with a passcode). | None | **High** | **Denied:** T1005, T1555 | **T1005:** Attackers access data stored on the local system. Encryption protects this data. **T1555:** Attackers steal passwords stored on the device. Encryption protects this data. |
| **Find My iPhone** | `Settings > [Your Name] > Find My` | - Enable "Find My iPhone". <br> - Enable "Send Last Location". | Minimal, slight battery usage | **High** | **Detects/Delayed:** T1041, T1537 | **T1041:** Attackers exfiltrate data over alternative network channels. Find My iPhone can help detect this by showing the device's location. **T1537:** Attackers transfer data to cloud accounts. Find My iPhone can help detect this and allow you to remotely lock or erase the device. |
| **iTunes Backup Encryption** (optional) | Connect to computer > Finder/iTunes > Device Summary/General tab | -  Check "Encrypt local backup" and set a strong password. | Requires remembering backup password | **Medium** | **Denied:** T1005, T1119 | **T1005:** Attackers access data in backups. Encryption protects this data. **T1119:** Attackers automate the collection of data. Encryption prevents easy access to backup data. |
